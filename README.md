:warning: __Since I was added to a [`language-latex`](https://github.com/area/language-latex)'s collaborator, no development will be made here for a while. Please switch to `language-latex` package.__

### Overview
The `language-tex` package provides your Atom with grammar and code snippets of TeX, LaTeX, BibTeX and so on.

This package is a forked project of [`language-latex`](https://github.com/area/language-latex) package to fix derelict bugs and add new features.
I appreciate the dedication the author and the contributors of the original package put into it.

### Install
Just run the following command:

```bash
apm install language-tex
```

If you prefer installation via GUI, you can go to `Atom` > `Settings` > `Install`, search for `language-tex` in Packages tab and install it.
